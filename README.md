# Shareable Sublime Text 3 settings

## Installation

### macOS

Create the Sublime Text 3 `Packages` directory and clone the repository. Cloning
only works if the `User` directory does not exist yet. If it already exists,
clone to a different directory and rename afterwards.

```bash
$ mkdir -p "/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages"
$ git clone git@github.com:matijs/sublime-settings.git \
> "/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User"
```
